```

## Endpoints

### GET /resource
Retrieve resources

**Parameters**:
| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| id | string | Yes | Resource identifier |
| filter | string | No | Filter results by criteria |

What it does and why it exists

#### Component 2
Its role in the system

### The Flow

1. Step-by-step process
2. With clear progression
3. Leading to outcome

## Example

- Scenario 2: Another appropriate use
- Scenario 3: Third use case

## Common Misconceptions

### Misconception 1

**Reality**: Correct understanding

### Misconception 2

**Reality**: What's actually true

## Comparison to Alternatives

How this compares to similar approaches

| Feature | This Approach | Alternative |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| Speed | Fast | Slow |
| Complexity | Simple | Complex |

## Further Reading

- Link to related concepts
- Advanced topics
- Official specifications

```

**Best Practices**:
- **Start Simple** - Build from basic to complex
- **Visual Aids** - Diagrams help understanding
- **Analogies** - Relate to familiar concepts
- **Address Confusion** - Clear up common misunderstandings
- **No Jargon** - Or define it when first used
- **Progressive Disclosure** - Layer information

## Writing Principles

### Clarity

**Be Direct**:
```

❌ It might be considered beneficial to potentially utilize...
✅ Use...

```

**Active Voice**:
```

❌ The function is called by the system
✅ The system calls the function

```

**Concrete Examples**:
```

❌ Configure the settings appropriately
✅ Set timeout to 5000ms in config.json

```

### Accuracy

**Test Everything**:
- Run all code examples
- Verify all commands work
- Check that screenshots match current UI
- Confirm version-specific information

**Be Precise**:
```

❌ Make sure the value is small
✅ Set the value between 1-100

```

**Version Specific**:
```

✅ In version 2.0+, use the new API:

```javascript
newAPI.method();
```

In version 1.x, use:

```javascript
oldAPI.method();
```

```

### Structure

**Scannable**:
- Use headings hierarchically (H1 > H2 > H3)
- Include table of contents for long docs
- Use lists and tables
- Break up text with code blocks

**Consistent**:
- Same terminology throughout
- Consistent formatting for code/commands
- Standard structure across similar docs
- Predictable organization

**Navigable**:
- Cross-link related docs
- Include "breadcrumbs" for context
- Add "Next steps" at end
- Provide search functionality

### Code Examples

**Complete and Runnable**:
```javascript
// ✅ Good - Complete working example
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

```javascript
// ❌ Bad - Incomplete, won't work
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World');
});
```

**Explain Key Parts**:

```javascript
// Create Express application
const app = express();

// Define route handler for GET requests to root
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World');
});

// Start server on port 3000
app.listen(3000);
```

**Show Input and Output**:

```bash
$ npm install express
added 57 packages in 3s

$ node server.js
Server running on port 3000
```

## Documentation Checklist

Before publishing documentation, verify:

- [ ] Technical accuracy verified by testing
- [ ] All code examples run without errors
- [ ] Screenshots/images are current
- [ ] Links work and point to correct locations
- [ ] Grammar and spelling checked
- [ ] Consistent terminology throughout
- [ ] Appropriate for target audience expertise level

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Assuming Knowledge** - Don't skip basics your audience needs
2. **Outdated Examples** - Keep code current with latest versions
3. **Broken Links** - Regularly check and update links
4. **Missing Context** - Explain why, not just how
5. **Inconsistent Terminology** - Pick terms and stick with them
6. **No Error Handling** - Show how to handle failures
7. **Incomplete Examples** - Provide full, working code
8. **Poor Organization** - Use clear hierarchy and structure
9. **No Troubleshooting** - Address common problems
10. **Jargon Overload** - Define technical terms or avoid them

## Style Guide Template

Establish consistent rules for your documentation:

**Formatting**:

- Code: `inline code` vs ```code blocks```
- Commands: Always show with $ prompt
- File paths: Use `/absolute/paths` or `relative/paths` consistently
- Placeholders: Use `<angle-brackets>` or `YOUR_API_KEY` format

**Terminology**:

- Consistent names for concepts
- Acronym usage (spell out first use)
- Capitalization rules
- Product/feature names

**Code Examples**:

- Language for examples
- Comment style
- Variable naming
- Indentation (tabs vs spaces)

**Voice and Tone**:

- Second person ("you") vs first person ("we")
- Formality level
- Humor appropriateness
- Cultural sensitivity
