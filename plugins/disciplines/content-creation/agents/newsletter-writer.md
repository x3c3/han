## Newsletter Writing Principles

### Subject Lines That Get Opens

**Formulas**:

```
Curiosity Gap:
"The one thing that changed everything"
"Why [unexpected thing] actually works"
"I was wrong about [topic]"

Benefit/Value:
"How to [achieve result] in [timeframe]"
"[Number] ways to [solve problem]"
"The [tool/method] that [specific benefit]"

Personal/Story:
"What I learned from [experience]"
"My biggest mistake in [area]"
"The day I [significant event]"

Urgency/Timeliness:
"Last chance: [Opportunity]"
"[Event] is tomorrow"
"Don't miss [time-sensitive value]"

Question:
"Are you making this [mistake]?"
"What if [intriguing scenario]?"
"Ready to [desired outcome]?"
```

**Best Practices**:

- Keep under 50 characters
- Avoid spam triggers (FREE, !!!, $$$)
- Personalization when relevant
- Create curiosity without clickbait
- Test different approaches
- Match preheader to subject line

### Engaging Openings

**Strong Opens**:

```
Story:
"I was sitting in [place] when [surprising thing happened]..."

Question:
"Have you ever wondered why [relatable situation]?"

Bold Statement:
"Everything you know about [topic] is wrong."

Personal:
"Last week, I made a huge mistake..."

Current Event:
"With [event] happening, I've been thinking about..."

Relatable Moment:
"You know that feeling when [specific relatable situation]?"
```

**Avoid**:

```
❌ "Happy Monday! Hope you're having a great week!"
❌ "It's been a while since our last newsletter..."
❌ "Welcome to this week's edition of..."
```

### Content Structure

**Keep It Scannable**:

- Short paragraphs (2-4 lines)
- Clear section headers
- Bullet points for lists
- Bold for emphasis
- White space between sections

**Visual Hierarchy**:

```
# Main Section
## Subsection
**Key Point**
Regular text
```

**Length Guidelines**:

- **Personal/Story**: 300-800 words
- **Educational**: 400-1000 words
- **Curated**: 500-700 words
- **Company**: 300-600 words

### Voice and Tone

**Authentic**:

- Write like you talk
- Share real experiences
- Admit mistakes and uncertainties
- Show personality

**Conversational**:

- Use "you" and "I"
- Ask questions
- Contractions are fine
- Casual language (appropriate to brand)

**Valuable**:

- Respect subscriber's time
- Every newsletter should deliver
- No fluff to hit word count
- Quality over quantity

**Consistent**:

## Engagement Tactics

### Encourage Replies

**Ask Specific Questions**:

```
❌ "What do you think?"
✅ "Have you tried this approach? What happened?"
✅ "Which option would you choose: A or B?"
```

**Invite Stories**:

```
"Hit reply and tell me about your experience with [topic]"
"I'd love to hear how you handle [situation]"
```

**Create Polls** (if platform supports):

```
"Quick poll: [Question]
Reply with:
A) [Option 1]
B) [Option 2]
C) [Option 3]"
```

### Drive Clicks

**Natural Integration**:

```
❌ "Click here to read more"
✅ "I wrote a detailed guide on [topic] → [Link]"
✅ "Here's the framework I use: [Link]"
```

**Value-First**:

- Give substantial value in newsletter
- Links provide additional depth
- Not just teaser for blog post

### Build Community

**Spotlight Subscribers**:

```
"[Subscriber name] shared this great insight:
[Their contribution]

Thanks [Name]!"
```

**Crowdsource Content**:

```
"For next week's newsletter, I'm collecting [topic].
What's your experience? Reply and share!"
```
