## General Writing Principles

### The Hook Formula

**Types of Hooks**:

1. **Shock/Surprise** - "I lost $50k learning this lesson"
2. **Question** - "Ever wonder why your content isn't getting engagement?"
3. **Bold Statement** - "Most social media advice is wrong"
4. **Relatability** - "If you've ever felt like giving up..."
5. **Curiosity Gap** - "The one thing nobody tells you about..."
6. **Number/List** - "7 mistakes killing your reach"
7. **Story Opening** - "Last week, something clicked..."

### Engagement Mechanics

**Drive Comments**:

- Ask specific questions
- Create polls (where platform allows)
- Request opinions on either/or choices
- "Tag someone who needs this"
- Invite personal experiences

**Drive Shares**:

- Educational value
- Inspirational/motivational
- Highly relatable
- Useful tools/resources
- Entertainment value

**Drive Saves**:

- Reference material
- Step-by-step guides
- Lists and frameworks
- Templates and examples
- "Bookmark for later" value

### Voice and Tone Guidelines

**Authentic**:

- Write like you speak
- Show personality
- Be vulnerable when appropriate
- Share real experiences

**Conversational**:

- Use "you" and "I"
- Ask questions
- Contractions are fine
- Casual language (platform-appropriate)

**Valuable**:

- Every post should give or entertain
- No fluff or filler
- Respect audience's time
- Deliver on the hook's promise

**Consistent**:

- Maintain brand voice across platforms
- Adapt tone to platform norms
- Keep messaging aligned
- Build recognizable style

## Content Calendar Strategy

### Content Pillars

Define 3-5 core themes that all content relates to:

- **Educational** - Teach something valuable
- **Inspirational** - Motivate and encourage
- **Entertainment** - Make people smile/laugh
- **Promotional** - Product/service highlights
- **Community** - Engagement and connection

### Content Mix

**80/20 Rule**:

- 80% value (educational, entertaining, inspiring)
- 20% promotional (product, service, sales)

**Variety**:

- Mix formats (text, image, video, carousel)
- Vary content types within pillars
- Balance serious and light content
- Alternate between topics

## Hashtag Strategy

### Research**

- Analyze competitor hashtags
- Use platform search to find related tags
- Check hashtag size (not too big, not too small)
- Identify trending relevant tags

### Mix**

- **Broad** (500k-1M+) - 1-2 tags for reach
- **Medium** (50k-500k) - 3-5 tags for targeting
- **Niche** (5k-50k) - 3-5 tags for community
- **Branded** - Your custom tags

### Placement**

- **Twitter/X** - In the tweet (1-2 max)
- **LinkedIn** - At the end (3-5)
- **Instagram** - First comment or caption end (8-15)
- **TikTok** - In caption (3-5)
- **Facebook** - Sparingly (1-3)

## Content Creation Checklist

Before posting, verify:

- [ ] Hook stops the scroll in first 1-3 seconds
- [ ] Value is clear and delivered
- [ ] Platform-appropriate length and format
- [ ] Mobile-friendly (most users on mobile)
- [ ] Clear call-to-action
- [ ] Hashtags researched and strategic
- [ ] Proofread for typos and clarity
- [ ] Visual assets are high quality
- [ ] Alt text added (accessibility)
- [ ] Post timing optimized for audience
- [ ] Consistent with brand voice
- [ ] Likely to drive target engagement (like/comment/share/save)

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Cross-posting without adaptation** - Each platform needs unique content
2. **Weak hooks** - If first line doesn't grab, post fails
3. **No clear CTA** - Tell people what to do next
4. **Over-promotion** - Too much selling kills engagement
5. **Ignoring comments** - Engagement is a conversation
6. **Hashtag stuffing** - Quality over quantity
7. **Inconsistent posting** - Algorithms reward consistency
8. **Following trends blindly** - Stay on-brand
9. **Writing for yourself** - Write for your audience
10. **No variety** - Same format/topic gets stale

## Platform-Specific Post Examples

### Twitter Thread Example

```
Tweet 1 (Hook):
The biggest mistake I made scaling to $1M: hiring too fast.

Here's what I learned about building the right team 🧵

Tweet 2:
Early on, I thought: more people = more growth.

So I hired aggressively.

Bad idea.

Tweet 3:
What I learned:

• Hire slow, fire fast
• Culture fit > resume
• Specialists > generalists (at first)
• One A-player > three B-players

Tweet 4:
The turning point: I fired 40% of the team in one month.

Brutal, but necessary.

Revenue actually increased.

Tweet 5:
Now I ask:
• Can I trust this person completely?
• Will they raise the bar?
• Do they share our values?

If any answer is "maybe," it's a no.

Tweet 6:
Your team is your company.

Hire like your business depends on it.

Because it does.

What's your biggest hiring lesson? 👇
```

### LinkedIn Post Example

```
I got fired 3 years ago today.

Best thing that ever happened to me.

Here's why getting fired might be the push you need:

---

I was comfortable. Too comfortable.

Safe job. Decent pay. Zero growth.

Then one Tuesday morning: "We're letting you go."

My world collapsed.

---

But here's what happened next:

Month 1: Panic. Applied to 50+ jobs. Got rejected.

Month 2: Reflection. What did I actually want?

Month 3: Started freelancing. Scared but excited.

Month 6: First $10k month. Mind blown.

Year 1: Replaced my salary. Never looking back.

---

Getting fired forced me to:

• Bet on myself
• Build real skills
• Take calculated risks
• Define success on my terms
• Stop playing it safe

---

I'm not saying getting fired is fun.

It's terrifying.

But sometimes the push you need comes disguised as rejection.

---

If you're going through a setback right now:

This might be your redirection, not your end.

The best chapters often start with "everything fell apart."

### Instagram Caption Example

```
POV: You just realized content creation is easier than you thought ✨

Here's the secret nobody tells you:

You don't need:
❌ Perfect lighting
❌ Expensive camera
❌ Professional editing
❌ Viral ideas

You DO need:
✅ Consistency
✅ Authenticity
✅ Value for your audience
✅ Willingness to improve

I started with an iPhone 11 and zero followers.

Now I create content full-time.

The difference? I showed up every single day.

Your turn 👇

What's stopping you from starting?
