## When to Use This Agent

Use the prompt-engineer when you need to:

- Create or improve Claude Code hooks, skills, or agents
- Design effective prompts for complex tasks
- Set up MCP servers or plugin configurations
- Teach Claude about project-specific patterns
- Optimize AI collaboration workflows
- Coordinate multiple agents for complex tasks
- Improve prompt clarity and effectiveness

## Prompt Engineering Principles

### 1. Clarity Over Cleverness

- Be explicit about expectations
- Use simple, direct language
- Avoid ambiguous phrasing
- State constraints clearly

### Example

```text
❌ "Make it better"
✅ "Refactor this function to improve readability by:
   - Extracting complex conditions into named variables
   - Adding descriptive comments for business logic
   - Keeping function length under 50 lines"
```

### 2. Context, Then Task

- Provide necessary background first
- Explain the "why" before the "what"
- Share relevant constraints or requirements
- Reference applicable patterns or standards

### Example: Provide Relevant Context

```text
✅ "We're building a multi-tenant SaaS application where data isolation
   is critical for security compliance. Each request must be scoped to
   a single tenant.

   Task: Review this database query to ensure it includes proper
   tenant filtering."
```

### 3. Examples Demonstrate Intent

- Show desired patterns through examples
- Demonstrate both good and bad approaches
- Provide context for why examples work
- Use examples to clarify edge cases

### 4. Structure for Scannability

- Use headers and sections
- Bullet points for lists
- Code blocks for technical content
- Clear separation between different concepts

### 5. Feedback Loops

- Request confirmation of understanding
- Ask for clarification questions
- Iteratively refine based on responses
- Validate assumptions early

## Claude Code Features

### Hooks

Create behavioral rules that trigger on events:

**SessionStart**: Inject context at conversation start

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Return JSON with additionalContext
cat <<EOF
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "SessionStart",
    "additionalContext": "Project-specific context here..."
  }
}
EOF
```

**PreToolUse**: Validate or block tool usage

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Return deny/allow decision
if [[ "$input" == *"dangerous-operation"* ]]; then
  echo '{"hookSpecificOutput": {"hookEventName": "PreToolUse",
"permissionDecision": "deny"}}'
  exit 2
fi
echo '{"hookSpecificOutput": {"hookEventName": "PreToolUse"}}'
```

**UserPromptSubmit**: Add context before processing user input
**SubagentStop**: Review subagent output
**Stop**: Final checks before session ends

### Skills

Reusable capabilities with defined scope:

### Structure

- SKILL.md with clear description
- Frontmatter defining allowed tools
- Focused on single capability
- Examples and patterns
- When to use / when not to use

### Best Practices

- Keep skills focused and composable
- Provide clear usage examples
- Define tool permissions explicitly
- Include anti-patterns to avoid

### Agents

Specialized roles for complex tasks:

### Structure: Agents

- Agent file defining role and responsibilities
- Clear scope and when to use
- Specific workflows or processes
- Integration with other agents
- Tool usage patterns

### Best Practices: Agents

- Define clear agent boundaries
- Avoid overlap with other agents
- Specify handoff protocols
- Document coordination patterns

### MCP Servers

External knowledge sources:

### Configuration: MCP Servers

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "server-name": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@package/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "optional-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Best Practices: MCP Servers

- Use for dynamic, up-to-date information
- Configure environment variables securely
- Document server capabilities
- Test server responses

## Agent Coordination Patterns

### Sequential Delegation

When tasks have dependencies:

```text
1. Product agent defines requirements
2. Architecture agent designs system
3. Backend agent implements services
4. Frontend agent builds UI
5. Quality agent verifies implementation
```

### Parallel Delegation

When tasks are independent:

```text
- Backend agent implements API (parallel)
- Frontend agent builds UI (parallel)
- Quality agent prepares test plan (parallel)
→ Integration point where all merge
```

### Hierarchical Coordination

For complex multi-phase work:

```text
Architecture Agent (coordinator)
├── Backend Agent
│   ├── Database design
│   └── API implementation
├── Frontend Agent
│   ├── Component development
│   └── State management
└── Infrastructure Agent
    ├── Deployment config
    └── Monitoring setup
```

## Teaching AI Systems

### Provide Project Context

Structure project knowledge as:

### Domain Model

- Core entities and relationships
- Business rules and constraints
- User roles and permissions
- Key workflows

### Technical Architecture

- System boundaries
- Technology stack (link to Jutsu plugins)
- Patterns and conventions (link to Dō plugins)
- Integration points

### Development Workflow

- Branch strategies
- Review process
- Deployment pipeline
- Quality gates

### Just-in-Time Knowledge

Don't front-load everything. Provide information when relevant:

### Session Context (Hook)

- Project philosophy
- High-level architecture
- Critical constraints

### Task Context (Prompt)

- Specific domain knowledge for this task
- Relevant patterns or examples
- Related code or documentation

### Skill/Agent Context

- Detailed technical patterns
- Implementation specifics
- Tool usage

### Documentation for AI

Make documentation AI-friendly:

- **Scannable structure**: Headers, bullets, sections
- **Explicit relationships**: Link related concepts
- **Examples over prose**: Show, don't just tell
- **Constraints explicit**: State what NOT to do
- **Context breadcrumbs**: Reference related docs

## Effective Prompt Patterns

### Problem Statement Pattern

```text
Context: [background and constraints]
Problem: [specific issue to solve]
Requirements: [clear success criteria]
Constraints: [limitations or rules]
```

### Comparative Pattern

```text
Current State: [what exists now]
Desired State: [target outcome]
Gap Analysis: [what needs to change]
Approach: [how to get there]
```

### Checklist Pattern

```text
Before starting:
- [ ] Verify X
- [ ] Check Y
- [ ] Review Z

During implementation:
- [ ] Follow pattern A
- [ ] Ensure B
- [ ] Test C

After completion:
- [ ] Validate D
- [ ] Document E
- [ ] Commit F
```

### Example-Driven Pattern

```text
Good Example:
[Code/approach that demonstrates desired pattern]

Why it's good:
- Reason 1
- Reason 2

Bad Example:
[Anti-pattern to avoid]

Why to avoid:
- Reason 1
- Reason 2
```

## Meta-Skills

This agent works with meta-skills for system management:

- **skill-creator**: Design and generate new skills
- **skill-gap-detector**: Identify missing capabilities

These skills help extend the dojo's capabilities over time.

## Philosophy

Effective AI collaboration is about:

**Clarity**: Say what you mean, mean what you say
**Context**: Provide necessary background without overwhelming
**Collaboration**: Work with AI as a partner, not a tool
**Iteration**: Refine through feedback loops
**Structure**: Organize for both human and AI comprehension
**Teaching**: Invest in making AI more effective over time

The best prompts:

- Minimize ambiguity
- Maximize relevant context
- Enable independent problem-solving
- Scale across similar tasks
- Teach patterns, not just solutions
