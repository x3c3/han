## Threat Modeling Framework

### STRIDE Methodology

Apply STRIDE to identify threats systematically:

### Spoofing Identity

- Can an attacker impersonate a legitimate user?
- Are authentication mechanisms robust?
- Is session management secure?

### Tampering with Data

- Can data be modified in transit or at rest?
- Are integrity checks in place?
- Is input validation comprehensive?

### Repudiation

- Can users deny performing actions?
- Are audit logs tamper-proof?
- Is non-repudiation enforced for critical operations?

### Information Disclosure

- Can sensitive data be accessed by unauthorized parties?
- Are error messages revealing too much information?
- Is data properly encrypted?

### Denial of Service

- Can the system be overwhelmed or made unavailable?
- Are rate limits implemented?
- Are resource exhaustion attacks prevented?

### Elevation of Privilege

- Can users gain unauthorized access levels?
- Are privilege boundaries enforced?
- Is the principle of least privilege followed?

### Threat Actor Profiles

### External Attackers

- Motivation: Financial gain, data theft, reputation damage
- Capabilities: Automated scanning, exploit tools, social engineering
- Targets: Public endpoints, authentication systems, valuable data

### Malicious Insiders

- Motivation: Revenge, financial gain, espionage
- Capabilities: Legitimate access, system knowledge, trust exploitation
- Targets: Sensitive data, administrative functions, audit systems

### Opportunistic Attackers

- Motivation: Low-effort exploitation, credential harvesting
- Capabilities: Automated tools, known exploits, mass scanning
- Targets: Unpatched systems, default credentials, exposed services

### Trust Boundary Analysis

Identify and secure trust boundaries:

1. **Network Boundaries**
   - Internet to DMZ
   - DMZ to internal network
   - Internal network to database layer
   - Third-party API integrations

2. **Application Boundaries**
   - Client to server
   - Microservice to microservice
   - Application to database
   - Application to cache/queue

3. **Data Boundaries**
   - Public to authenticated user data
   - User data to PII
   - Regular access to privileged access
   - Production to development/test

## Common Vulnerability Patterns

### SQL Injection Prevention

### Pattern: Parameterized Queries

```text
VULNERABLE - String Concatenation:
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '" + email + "'"

SECURE - Parameterized Query:
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?"
execute(query, [email])
```

### Pattern: ORM Safe Queries

```text
VULNERABLE - Raw SQL with user input:
db.execute("SELECT * FROM resources WHERE id = " + resource_id)

SECURE - ORM query builder:
db.query(Resource).filter(id=resource_id).first()
```

### XSS Prevention

### Pattern: Output Encoding

```text
VULNERABLE - Direct HTML insertion:
element.innerHTML = userContent

SECURE - Encoded output:
element.textContent = userContent
// Or use framework-provided sanitization
```

### Pattern: Content Security Policy

```text
SECURE - Restrict content sources:
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'nonce-{random}'
```

### CSRF Protection

### Pattern: Anti-CSRF Tokens

```text
SECURE - Synchronizer token pattern:
1. Generate random token on form load
2. Include token in form submission
3. Verify token on server side
4. Reject requests with missing/invalid tokens
```

### Pattern: SameSite Cookies

```text
SECURE - Cookie configuration:
Set-Cookie: session=value; SameSite=Strict; Secure; HttpOnly
```

### Authorization Bypass Prevention

### Pattern: Resource Ownership Verification

```text
VULNERABLE - Trusting client-supplied IDs:
function getResource(resourceId) {
  return database.get(resourceId)
}

SECURE - Verify ownership:
function getResource(userId, resourceId) {
  resource = database.get(resourceId)
  if (resource.ownerId != userId) {
    throw UnauthorizedError
  }
  return resource
}
```

### Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

### Pattern: Access Control Checks

```text
SECURE - Verify authorization:
function getTransaction(currentUser, transactionId) {
  transaction = database.get(transactionId)
  if (!currentUser.canAccess(transaction)) {
    throw UnauthorizedError
  }
  return transaction
}
```

### Sensitive Data Exposure

### Pattern: Data Redaction

```text
SECURE - Remove sensitive fields from logs:
function logTransaction(transaction) {
  safeData = {
    id: transaction.id,
    amount: transaction.amount,
    timestamp: transaction.timestamp
    // Omit: card_number, cvv, account_number
  }
  logger.info("Transaction processed", safeData)
}
```

### Pattern: Encryption at Rest

```text
SECURE - Encrypt sensitive fields:
1. Use platform-appropriate encryption libraries
2. Store encryption keys in secret management systems
3. Encrypt before writing to database
4. Decrypt only when needed
```

## Security Architecture Patterns

### Defense in Depth

Layer multiple security controls:

1. **Perimeter Security**
   - Firewall rules
   - DDoS protection
   - WAF (Web Application Firewall)

2. **Network Security**
   - Network segmentation
   - VPN/private networks
   - Intrusion detection

3. **Application Security**
   - Input validation
   - Authentication/authorization
   - Security headers

4. **Data Security**
   - Encryption at rest
   - Encryption in transit
   - Access logging

### Zero Trust Architecture

Never trust, always verify:

1. **Identity Verification**
   - Authenticate every request
   - Verify user and device identity
   - Continuous authentication

2. **Least Privilege Access**
   - Grant minimum necessary permissions
   - Time-bound access grants
   - Regular permission reviews

3. **Micro-segmentation**
   - Isolate workloads
   - Enforce strict access controls
   - Monitor inter-service communication

### Secure Design Principles

1. **Security by Design**
   - Consider security from inception
   - Threat model early and often
   - Build security into requirements

2. **Fail Secure**
   - Default to deny access
   - Handle errors securely
   - Don't reveal system details in errors

3. **Complete Mediation**
   - Check every access attempt
   - Don't rely on cached permissions
   - Validate at enforcement points

4. **Economy of Mechanism**
   - Keep security mechanisms simple
   - Reduce attack surface
   - Minimize complexity

## Security Tools & Techniques

### Dependency Scanning

Use dependency scanning tools appropriate to your ecosystem:

- Package vulnerability scanners
- Software composition analysis (SCA)
- License compliance checking
- Automated dependency updates

### Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

Analyze source code for vulnerabilities:

- Code pattern matching
- Data flow analysis
- Control flow analysis
- Automated code review

### Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)

Test running applications:

- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Fuzzing
- API security testing
- Authentication/authorization testing

### Security Headers

Implement protective HTTP headers:

```text
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()
```

### Secrets Management

Never commit secrets to version control:

### Secrets Management Best Practices

1. Use environment variables for configuration
2. Use secret management systems (vault services)
3. Rotate secrets regularly
4. Encrypt secrets at rest
5. Audit secret access
6. Use short-lived credentials when possible

### Pattern: Secret Rotation

```text
SECURE - Automated rotation:
1. Generate new secret
2. Deploy new secret alongside old
3. Update applications to use new secret
4. Remove old secret after grace period
5. Verify rotation success
```
