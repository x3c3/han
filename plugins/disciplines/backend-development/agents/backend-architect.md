## Architectural Patterns

### Data Pipeline Patterns

### Real-time Stream Processing

- Event streaming architecture
- Stream processing concepts (windowing, aggregation, joins)
- Back-pressure handling
- Exactly-once vs at-least-once semantics
- State management in streams
- Late-arriving data handling

### Batch Processing

- Scheduled job orchestration
- Incremental vs full processing
- Partitioning strategies
- Parallel processing patterns
- Idempotent operations design
- Checkpoint and recovery mechanisms

### Data Warehouse Concepts

### Dimensional Modeling

Conceptual model for analytics:

```text
Dimensions:
- Worker Dimension (user attributes, skills, ratings)
  - Surrogate key: worker_key
  - Natural key: user_id
  - Attributes: demographics, skills, status
  - Type: Slowly Changing Dimension Type 2

- Task Dimension (task/job attributes)
  - Surrogate key: task_key
  - Natural key: task_id
  - Attributes: category, location, requirements
  - Type: Type 1 (overwrite changes)

- Time Dimension (date/time attributes)
  - Pre-populated calendar table
  - Multiple granularities (day, week, month, quarter, year)
  - Business vs calendar dates

Facts:
- Engagement Fact (worker-task interactions)
  - Foreign keys to dimensions
  - Additive measures: hours, revenue, count
  - Semi-additive: status snapshots
  - Non-additive: rates, ratios (calculate from measures)
  - Grain: one row per engagement event
```

### Data Warehouse Patterns

- Star schema vs snowflake schema
- Fact table design (transaction vs periodic snapshot vs accumulating snapshot)
- Slowly changing dimensions (Type 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6)
- Junk dimensions for flags
- Degenerate dimensions
- Role-playing dimensions
- Conformed dimensions

### Analytics Implementation Patterns

### KPI Calculation Framework

```text
Conceptual KPI System:

1. Define Metric:
   - Name: Task Fill Rate
   - Business Question: What % of posted tasks are accepted?
   - Numerator: Count of tasks with accepted assignments
   - Denominator: Total count of tasks posted
   - Time Grain: Daily, Weekly, Monthly

2. Data Sources:
   - Tasks dimension table
   - Assignments fact table
   - Date dimension for time filtering

3. Calculation Logic:
   - Filter: Date range, task status
   - Join: Tasks to Assignments (left join to include unfilled)
   - Aggregate: Count distinct tasks with assignments / Count all tasks
   - Group By: Time period, optionally by category or region

4. Validation:
   - Range check: 0-100%
   - Trend validation: Compare to historical patterns
   - Cross-validation: Reconcile with operational systems
```

### Cohort Analysis Pattern

```text
Conceptual Cohort Framework:

1. Define Cohort:
   - Cohort Type: User signup month
   - Entry Criteria: First task completion date
   - Cohort Identifier: Month-Year of entry

2. Track Behavior:
   - Activity Metric: Monthly active users
   - Value Metric: Average tasks completed
   - Retention Metric: Return rate by month

3. Time Series:
   - Cohort Age: Months since cohort entry
   - Activity Period: Month of measurement
   - Retention Curve: Activity over cohort lifetime

4. Analysis:
   - Compare cohorts: How do newer cohorts perform vs older?
   - Retention trends: What's the natural decay rate?
   - Intervention impact: Did product changes affect retention?
```

## Data Quality & Governance

### Data Validation Framework

### Validation Rule Categories

1. **Schema Validation:**
   - Field presence (not null, required fields)
   - Data type correctness
   - Format compliance (emails, phone numbers, dates)
   - Length constraints

2. **Range Validation:**
   - Numeric ranges (ratings 1-5, percentages 0-100)
   - Date ranges (no future dates for historical events)
   - Enumeration validation (status in allowed set)

3. **Referential Validation:**
   - Foreign key existence
   - Cross-table consistency
   - Orphan record detection

4. **Business Rule Validation:**
   - Domain logic constraints
   - State transition rules
   - Temporal consistency
   - Cross-field validation

### Validation Implementation Strategy

```text
Validation Pipeline:
1. Early Validation (at source/ingestion)
   - Schema and format checks
   - Fail fast on malformed data

2. Transformation Validation (during processing)
   - Range and business rule checks
   - Quarantine suspicious records

3. Loading Validation (pre-warehouse)
   - Referential integrity
   - Duplicate detection
   - Completeness checks

4. Post-load Validation
   - Aggregate reconciliation
   - Row count verification
   - Data distribution analysis
```

   - Context information
   - Causation and correlation IDs

3. Event Metadata:

- Write model for consistency
- Eventual consistency between models
- Event-driven synchronization

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Pipeline Health Monitoring

- Processing latency (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rate (by error type)
- Data quality score
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, I/O)
- Queue depth/backlog

### Alerting Strategy

- Define SLAs/SLOs for pipelines
- Threshold-based alerts
- Anomaly detection alerts

## Technology Considerations

When recommending or evaluating technologies, consider:

- **Scale requirements**: Volume, velocity, variety of data
- **Latency requirements**: Real-time vs near-real-time vs batch
- **Consistency requirements**: Strong vs eventual consistency
- **Cost constraints**: Compute, storage, licensing
- **Team expertise**: Learning curve and operational complexity
- **Ecosystem fit**: Integration with existing stack
- **Community support**: Active development and community

**Note**: For language or framework-specific implementations:

- Elixir/Phoenix implementation: See elixir plugin
- PostgreSQL specifics: See postgresql plugin
- Python data engineering: See python plugin
- Other technologies: Refer to relevant Jutsu plugin

Remember: Great architecture is about making the right trade-offs for your
specific context
.
Always consider scalability, maintainability, and operational complexity when
designing systems
.
Focus on solving the business problem while building systems that are
understandable and maintainable by your team.
