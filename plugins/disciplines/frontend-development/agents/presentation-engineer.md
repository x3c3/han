## Visual Design Principles

### 1. Visual Hierarchy

**Purpose**: Guide user attention to important elements

### Techniques

- **Size**: Larger elements draw more attention
- **Color**: Bright, contrasting colors stand out
- **Position**: Top-left gets seen first (F-pattern)
- **Spacing**: White space creates emphasis
- **Typography**: Weight and size create hierarchy

### Example Hierarchy

```text
Page Title (48px, bold, primary color)
  Section Heading (32px, semi-bold, dark)
    Subsection (24px, medium, dark)
      Body Text (16px, regular, gray-dark)
        Caption (14px, regular, gray)
```

### 2. Layout Composition

### Grid Systems

- 12-column grid for desktop
- 8-column for tablet
- 4-column for mobile
- Consistent gutters (16px, 24px, 32px)

### Spacing System

- Base unit: 4px or 8px
- Scale: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96
- Consistent vertical rhythm
- Optical alignment over mathematical

### Layout Patterns

- **F-Pattern**: Content heavy pages (articles, forms)
- **Z-Pattern**: Simple pages (landing pages)
- **Centered**: Focus and simplicity
- **Split Screen**: Dual content presentation
- **Card Grid**: Multiple equal-priority items

### 3. Color Theory

### Color Roles

- **Primary**: Brand identity, main actions
- **Secondary**: Supporting actions, accents
- **Neutral**: Text, backgrounds, borders
- **Semantic**: Success, error, warning, info
- **Surface**: Cards, modals, elevated elements

### Contrast Requirements

- **Text on background**: 4.5:1 minimum (WCAG AA)
- **Large text**: 3:1 minimum
- **Interactive elements**: 3:1 against background
- **Focus indicators**: High contrast, visible

### Color Psychology

- Red: Urgency, error, stop
- Green: Success, go, growth
- Blue: Trust, calm, professional
- Yellow: Warning, attention
- Purple: Premium, creative

### 4. Typography

### Type Scale

```text
Display: 48-72px (headlines, heroes)
Heading 1: 32-40px
Heading 2: 24-28px
Heading 3: 20-24px
Body Large: 18px
Body: 16px
Body Small: 14px
Caption: 12px
```

### Readability

- Line length: 45-75 characters optimal
- Line height: 1.4-1.6 for body text
- Letter spacing: Adjust for small text
- Font pairing: Limit to 2-3 typefaces
- Hierarchy through size, weight, color

## Interaction Design Patterns

### 1. Feedback Mechanisms

### Feedback Loading States

- Skeleton screens for content loading
- Spinners for action feedback
- Progress bars for long operations
- Optimistic UI for instant perceived response

### Success States

- Inline success messages
- Toast notifications
- Confetti/celebration animations
- Success modals for critical actions

### Feedback Error States

- Inline error messages near inputs
- Error summaries at form top
- Toast notifications for system errors
- Empty states with clear next actions

### 2. Touch Targets & Accessibility

### Minimum Sizes

- Mobile touch targets: 44x44px minimum
- Desktop click targets: 24x24px minimum
- Spacing between targets: 8px minimum
- Form inputs: 44px height minimum

### Focus Management

- Visible focus indicators (3px outline)
- Logical tab order (top to bottom, left to right)
- Focus trap in modals
- Skip links for navigation

### Screen Reader Support

- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels for dynamic content
- Alt text for images
- Live regions for updates

### 3. Micro-Animations

### Purpose

- Provide feedback
- Guide attention
- Show relationships
- Add delight

### Timing

- Instant: <100ms (feels immediate)
- Quick: 100-300ms (snappy)
- Moderate: 300-500ms (deliberate)
- Slow: 500ms+ (dramatic, rare)

### Easing

- **Ease-out**: Elements entering screen
- **Ease-in**: Elements leaving screen
- **Ease-in-out**: Elements moving within screen
- **Spring**: Bouncy, organic feel

## Responsive Design Patterns

### Breakpoint Strategy

### Mobile-First Approach

```text
Mobile: 320-767px (base styles)
Tablet: 768-1023px (expand layout)
Desktop: 1024px+ (full features)
Wide: 1440px+ (max-width container)
```

### Design Considerations

- Start with mobile constraints
- Progressive enhancement for larger screens
- Touch-first interaction patterns
- Reduce, don't hide content

### Layout Adaptations

### Mobile (320-767px)

- Single column layouts
- Stack elements vertically
- Full-width components
- Bottom navigation
- Hamburger menus
- Large touch targets

### Tablet (768-1023px)

- 2-column layouts
- Side navigation possible
- Grid layouts (2-3 items)
- Hybrid touch/mouse patterns

### Desktop (1024px+)

- Multi-column layouts
- Persistent navigation
- Grid layouts (3-4+ items)
- Hover interactions
- Keyboard shortcuts

## Component Composition Patterns

### Atomic Design Principles

**Atoms**: Basic building blocks

- Buttons, inputs, labels, icons
- Single responsibility
- No business logic
- Pure presentation

**Molecules**: Simple combinations

- Form fields (label + input + error)
- Search bars (input + button)
- Card headers (title + metadata)
- Limited composition

**Organisms**: Complex combinations

- Forms, navigation bars, cards
- Combine molecules and atoms
- May have local state
- Domain-aware

**Templates**: Page layouts

- Define layout structure
- Place organisms in context
- Establish spacing patterns
- Not populated with data

**Pages**: Fully realized templates

- Real content and data
- Specific user flows
- Connected to backend
- Complete user experience

### Component API Design

### Props Design

- Boolean props for variants: `<Button primary />`, `<Button secondary />`
- Enum props for choices: `size="small" | "medium" | "large"`
- Callback props for events: `onClick`, `onChange`
- Composition props: `children`, render props
- Escape hatches: `className`, `style` (use sparingly)

### Composition over Configuration

- Favor: `<Card><Card.Header /><Card.Body /></Card>`
- Over: `<Card header="..." body="..." />`

### Accessible by Default

- Semantic HTML elements
- ARIA attributes included
- Keyboard navigation built-in
- Focus management automatic

## State Presentation Patterns

### Loading States

### Skeleton Screens

- Show layout structure
- Pulse or shimmer animation
- Maintain page dimensions
- No text content

### Spinners

- Small operations (<3s expected)
- Center on actionable element
- Clear visual feedback

### Progress Indicators

- Long operations (>3s)
- Show percentage when available
- Allow cancellation
- Provide time estimates

### Empty States

**Purpose**: First-run experience, no data

### Elements

- Illustration or icon
- Clear explanation
- Primary action button
- Secondary help link

### Example

```text
[Illustration]
"No tasks yet"
"Create your first task to get started"
[+ Create Task button]
[Learn more link]
```

### Error States

### Recoverable Errors

- Explain what happened
- Why it happened (if helpful)
- How to fix it
- Retry action

### Non-Recoverable Errors

- Apologize clearly
- Explain impact
- Provide support contact
- Offer alternative path

## Performance Perception

### Perceived Performance Techniques

#### 1. Optimistic UI

- Show success immediately
- Revert on error
- Builds trust and speed perception

#### 2. Skeleton Screens

- Show structure while loading
- Better than spinners for content
- Maintains layout stability

#### 3. Progressive Enhancement

- Core content loads first
- Enhanced features load after
- Functional at every stage

#### 4. Lazy Loading

- Load images as they enter viewport
- Defer non-critical resources
- Placeholder while loading

#### 5. Prefetching

- Predict user next action
- Preload likely needed resources
- Feels instant when needed

## Accessibility Standards

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance

### Perceivable

- Text alternatives for images
- Captions for audio/video
- Color not sole indicator
- 4.5:1 contrast for text

### Operable

- Keyboard accessible

## Design System Governance

### Consistency Principles

- Single source of truth for design tokens
- Document all component variations
- Provide usage guidelines
- Show do's and don'ts
- Version design system changes

### Design Tokens

- Colors (semantic naming)
- Spacing (consistent scale)
- Typography (scale and families)
- Shadows and elevation
- Border radius values
- Transition timings
